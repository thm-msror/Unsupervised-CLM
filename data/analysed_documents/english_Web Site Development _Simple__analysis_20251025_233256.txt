-   **Party 2 (DEVELOPER) Must:** Design, develop, and host the website according to the proposal and deliver all final work product ("Deliverables") to the COMPANY.

**5. LEGALITY**
-   **Governing Law:** The laws of the state of New York.
-   **Dispute Resolution:** All disputes must be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
-   **High Risk Items:** The payment clause is contradictory, the developer's liability for infringement is capped, and the 99-year term is commercially impractical.
-   **Clause References:**
    -   **Payment Ambiguity:** "The total price...shall be SEVEN THOUSAND, FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($7,500.00)...COMPANY will forward...($7,500.00) and an additional...($2,500.00)..." - Section 4.A.
    -   **Liability Cap:** "DEVELOPER’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed twice the amount of revenue derived by DEVELOPER under this Agreement." - Section 6.D.
-   **Missing Protections:** The agreement lacks a modern data privacy/protection clause and a specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) for website uptime and performance.
-   **Overall Risk Level:** **Medium to High** for the COMPANY due to the ambiguous payment terms, capped indemnification liability, and an excessively long term.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
-   **Top Priority:** Immediately clarify the contradictory payment amounts in Section 4.A and renegotiate the liability cap in Section 6.D to ensure adequate protection.
-   **Should Legal Review:** **Yes**, a legal professional should review and redraft the ambiguous payment terms, the liability cap, the impractical 99-year term, and add missing data protection clauses.
