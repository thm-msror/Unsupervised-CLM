### **Software Development Agreement Analysis**

**1. BASIC INFO**
- **Contract Type:** A Software Development Agreement for creating and supporting a custom software system.
- **Main Parties:** HEMISFAIR PARK AREA REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION ("HPARC") and an unnamed Software Developer ("ﻣﻄﻮﺭ ﺍﻟﺒﺮﺍﻣﺞ").
- **Purpose:** HPARC is retaining the Software Developer to provide software development, consulting, and support services.

**2. KEY DATES**
- **Start Date:** Not specified; the date is left blank ("ﺍﻋﺘﺒﺎﺭﺍ ﻣﻦ ﻳﻮﻡ ، 2021").
- **End Date:** Not specified; the term is left blank ("ﺗﺴﺘﻤﺮ ﻟﻤﺪﺓ __________").
- **Important Deadlines:** Delivery dates are to be defined in a separate "Implementation Plan," with a penalty of $100 per day for delays.

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
- **Total Value:** Not specified; the total lump sum fee is left blank ("($________)").
- **Payment Schedule:** Monthly invoices based on a "percentage complete" for each task, payable within 30 days of receipt.
- **Late Fees:** No penalties are mentioned for late payments by HPARC, but a $100/day credit is due to HPARC for late delivery by the Developer.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
- **Party 1 (Developer) Must:** Develop, maintain, and support the software system, and provide weekly status reports.
- **Party 2 (HPARC) Must:** Pay all undisputed invoices within 30 days and provide the Developer with necessary training on its systems.

**5. LEGALITY**
- **Governing Law:** The laws of the State of Texas.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Any dispute will be settled by arbitration in Washington D.C. under the American Arbitration Association rules.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- **High Risk Items:** The contract is a template with critical information missing, creating ambiguity. It also contains one-sided clauses favoring HPARC, particularly regarding termination rights and intellectual property ownership.
- **Clause References:**
    - **Ambiguous Payment:** Payment is based on "ﻧﺴﺒﺔ ﻣﺌﻮﻳﺔ ﻣﻜﺘﻤﻠﺔ" (percentage complete), which is subjective and can cause disputes without clear milestones (Section 4.b).
    - **Unilateral Termination:** HPARC can terminate without cause, but if the Developer does, HPARC can force a 180-day extension (Section 7).
    - **Unlimited IP Indemnity:** The Developer provides a broad, uncapped indemnification for intellectual property infringement, posing a significant financial risk (Section 13).
- **Missing Protections:** A **Limitation of Liability** clause is critically absent for the Developer, exposing them to potentially unlimited financial damages.
- **Overall Risk Level:** **High for the Developer.** The combination of blank essential terms, one-sided clauses, and the lack of a liability cap creates substantial legal and financial exposure.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Top Priority:** **Do not sign as is.** All blank fields (Developer name, dates, duration, total fees) must be completed, and objective payment milestones must be defined.
- **Should Legal Review:** **Yes.** The agreement requires professional legal review to negotiate fairer terms, especially regarding termination, liability, and indemnification, before it is executed.
