Of course. Here is a comprehensive analysis of the provided Managed Service Provider Agreement.

***

### **1. CONTRACT OVERVIEW**

*   **Document Type and Purpose:**
    *   This is a **Managed Service Provider (MSP) Agreement**.
    *   Its purpose is to establish a legal relationship where Corelight, Inc. ("Company") appoints another entity ("MSP") as a non-exclusive partner. This appointment authorizes the MSP to license, deploy, and manage Corelight's products ("Licensed MSP Products") as part of a managed service offering ("MSP Service") to the MSP's own end customers ("MSP Customers").

*   **Primary Business Relationship:**
    *   The relationship is a **B2B (Business-to-Business) channel partnership**.
    *   Corelight acts as the technology vendor and licensor.
    *   The MSP acts as a service provider and value-added reseller, integrating Corelight's technology into its own service portfolio and managing it on behalf of third-party clients. The MSP is an independent contractor, not an agent or employee of Corelight (Section 16).

### **2. KEY PARTIES**

*   **All Contracting Parties and Their Roles:**
    *   **Corelight, Inc. ("Company"):** The owner and licensor of the software and products. Corelight provides the technology, sets the pricing, and offers support to the MSP.
    *   **MSP (Managed Service Provider):** The licensee. The MSP purchases licenses from Corelight, markets the services, manages the product deployment for its clients, and is the primary point of contact for its own customers.

*   **Legal Entities Involved:**
    *   **Corelight, Inc.:** A legal corporate entity.
    *   **MSP:** The other signatory to the agreement, whose legal name would be filled in the blank.
    *   **MSP Customer(s):** A critical third party. While not a signatory to this agreement, the MSP Customer is the ultimate end-user of the service. The MSP is obligated to bind its customers to terms that are at least as protective of Corelight as Corelight's own Master Customer Agreement (MCA) (Section 6.1).

### **3. IMPORTANT DATES**

*   **Effective Date:** The date on which the last party signs the agreement.

*   **Expiration Dates:**
    *   **Initial Term:** The agreement has an initial term of twelve (12) months (Section 15.1).
    *   **Renewal:** It automatically renews for successive twelve (12) month periods unless cancelled by either party (Section 15.1).

*   **Key Deadlines and Milestones:**
    *   **Payment Due Date:** Invoices are due "net thirty (30) days from receipt" (Section 7.1).
    *   **Price Change Notice:** Corelight must provide at least thirty (30) days' notice for price changes (Section 7.1).
    *   **Warranty Period:** Corelight provides a limited warranty for ninety (90) days from the date of shipment (Section 9.1).
    *   **Termination for Cause:** A party has a fifteen (15) day period to cure a breach after receiving written notice (Section 15.2).
    *   **Termination without Cause:** Either party may terminate the agreement for any reason with ninety (90) days' written notice (Section 15.2).
    *   **Audit Notice:** Corelight must provide fifteen (15) business days' written notice to conduct an audit (Section 7.5).
    *   **Audit Overage Cure Period:** If an audit reveals overuse, the MSP has forty-eight (48) hours to terminate the overage or upgrade (Section 7.5).
    *   **Customer Update Obligation:** MSP must ensure its customers are operating with the most current updates within thirty (30) business days of their release (Section 10).
    *   **Post-Termination:** Within one (1) month of termination, the MSP must return or certify the destruction of the Licensed MSP Product (Section 15.4).

### **4. FINANCIAL TERMS**

*   **Payment Amounts and Schedules:**
    *   **Amounts:** Prices are determined by Corelight's "then-current price list" for the specific Model/SKU ordered (Section 7.1).
    *   **Schedule:** For subscription terms, Corelight invoices the MSP in advance (monthly, quarterly, or annually). All payments are due Net 30 days in U.S. Dollars (Sections 7.1, 7.3).
    *   **No Contingency:** Fees are payable in full regardless of whether the MSP collects payment from its own customers (Section 7.1).

*   **Pricing Structures:**
    *   **Order-Based:** MSP submits purchase orders for specific SKUs.
    *   **Subscription Model:** The primary model is subscription-based.
    *   **Upgrades:** MSPs can upgrade to a higher-capability model during a subscription term, with fees adjusted accordingly. Downgrades are not permitted during a term (Section 7.2).

*   **Penalties and Fees:**
    *   **Late Payment Interest:** Past due amounts accrue interest at 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law (Section 7.3).
    *   **Taxes:** The MSP is responsible for all sales, use, and similar taxes, which will be added to the invoice unless a valid exemption certificate is provided (Section 7.4).
    *   **Audit Penalties:** If an audit reveals an underpayment of more than 5% or a license violation, the MSP must pay the shortfall *and* Corelight's reasonable audit costs (Section 7.5).

### **5. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

*   **Governing Law:** The laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law rules (Section 19.7).

*   **Jurisdiction:** Exclusive jurisdiction and venue are in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California (Section 19.7).

*   **Dispute Resolution:**
    *   The primary method is **litigation** in the designated California courts.
    *   The agreement allows the prevailing party in any action to recover reasonable costs and attorney's fees.
    *   For breaches of confidentiality or restrictive covenants, Corelight is entitled to seek **injunctive relief** without posting a bond, as monetary damages are considered inadequate (Sections 12, 18, 19.7).

### **6. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**

*   **Corelight's (Company) Responsibilities:**
    *   Appoint the MSP as a non-exclusive partner.
    *   Grant the necessary licenses for the MSP to provide its services.
    *   Deliver the Licensed MSP Products and associated Documentation.
    *   Provide standard support services directly to the MSP (not the MSP's customers).
    *   Provide a limited 90-day product warranty.
    *   Indemnify the MSP against third-party U.S. intellectual property infringement claims, subject to several key exceptions (Section 13).

*   **MSP's Responsibilities:**
    *   **Contractual Flow-Down:** Ensure its agreements with MSP Customers contain terms at least as protective of Corelight as the Corelight MCA and name Corelight as a third-party beneficiary (Section 6.1).
    *   **Payment:** Pay all invoices in full and on time.
    *   **Marketing & Sales:** Market and promote the services and participate in monthly pipeline review meetings with Corelight (Section 6.2).
    *   **Compliance:** Adhere to all license restrictions, including prohibitions on reverse engineering, modification, and sublicensing (Section 8).
    *   **Customer Support:** Act as the frontline support for all MSP Customers (Section 11).
    *   **Indemnification:** Indemnify Corelight against claims arising from the MSP's breach of its obligations, its general activities, and its customers' use of the products (Sections 6.1, 10, 16).
    *   **Audit Compliance:** Permit and cooperate with audits of its records and systems (Section 7.5).
    *   **Confidentiality:** Protect Corelight's Confidential Information (Section 12).

### **7. RISK ANALYSIS**

This agreement is heavily weighted in favor of Corelight, Inc. The MSP assumes significant operational and legal risks.

*   **High-Risk Clauses (for the MSP):**
    *   **Indemnification Obligations (Sections 6.1, 10(f), 16):** The MSP holds broad indemnification duties. It must cover Corelight for any claims arising from its failure to bind customers to proper terms, any liability related to customer use of the product, and any claims related to its status as an independent contractor. This is a substantial transfer of risk to the MSP.
    *   **Limited Warranty and Broad Disclaimer (Section 9):** Corelight's warranty is only for 90 days. After that, the product is provided "as-is." The MSP is caught in the middle, as it may offer a longer service level agreement (SLA) to its own customers but has no contractual recourse against Corelight for product failures after 90 days.
    *   **Audit Rights (Section 7.5):** The audit clause gives Corelight significant power. The 48-hour cure period for overuse is extremely aggressive and may be operationally difficult to meet. The financial penalty of paying for the audit if underpayment exceeds 5% adds financial risk.
    *   **Limitation of Liability (Section 14):** Corelight's total liability is capped at the fees paid by the MSP in the preceding 12 months. This cap, combined with the exclusion of all indirect and consequential damages, means the MSP's potential recovery from Corelight for a catastrophic failure is severely limited.
    *   **Termination for Convenience (Section 15.2):** The 90-day "without cause" termination clause creates business uncertainty for an MSP that invests heavily in building a service offering around Corelight's products.

*   **Potential Liability Issues:**
    *   **Customer Disputes:** The MSP is fully responsible for its customers. If a customer suffers a loss due to a product defect outside the 90-day warranty, the customer will sue the MSP. The MSP, in turn, will have little to no ability to hold Corelight liable due to the warranty disclaimers and liability caps.
    *   **IP Indemnity Gaps (Section 13.2):** Corelight's duty to indemnify for IP infringement has many common but critical exceptions (e.g., combining the product with other software, failure to install an update). The MSP could be exposed to an infringement claim that Corelight can legally refuse to defend.

*   **Compliance Requirements:**
    *   **Export Control (Section 19.5):** The MSP is responsible for ensuring neither it nor its customers violate U.S. export laws, including restrictions on providing services to embargoed countries. This requires due diligence on the MSP's customer base.
    *   **Contract Management:** The MSP must maintain a rigorous process to ensure every customer signs an agreement that meets the flow-down requirements of Section 6.1. Failure to do so constitutes a breach and triggers indemnification.
    *   **Technical Compliance:** The MSP must ensure its customers install updates within 30 days, which can be an operational challenge to manage and enforce across a client base.
