### **Contract Analysis: Managed Service Provider Agreement**

---

**1. BASIC INFO**
-   **Contract Type:** A Managed Service Provider (MSP) Agreement.
-   **Main Parties:** Corelight, Inc. (“Company”) and an unnamed Managed Service Provider (“MSP”).
-   **Purpose:** To appoint the MSP as a non-exclusive provider of the Company's products and services to the MSP's own customers.

**2. KEY DATES**
-   **Start Date:** The last date the agreement is signed by both parties ("Effective Date").
-   **End Date:** The initial term is 12 months, with automatic 12-month renewals unless cancelled.
-   **Important Deadlines:** Invoices are due in 30 days; termination without cause requires 90 days' notice.

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
-   **Total Value:** Not specified; value is based on purchase orders placed against a price list.
-   **Payment Schedule:** Invoices are due net 30 days from receipt; subscriptions are billed in advance (monthly, quarterly, or annually).
-   **Late Fees:** Interest may be charged at 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
-   **Party 1 (Company) Must:** Grant the MSP a non-exclusive license to distribute and deploy its products and provide standard support services.
-   **Party 2 (MSP) Must:** Pay all fees on time and ensure its agreements with customers are at least as protective of the Company as the Company's own Master Customer Agreement.

**5. LEGALITY**
-   **Governing Law:** The laws of the State of California.
-   **Dispute Resolution:** Disputes will be handled in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
-   **High Risk Items:** The agreement contains a very broad, one-sided indemnification obligation on the MSP, an aggressive audit clause, and a severe limitation of the Company's liability.
-   **Clause References:** The MSP must indemnify the Company for any liability from customer use, and the Company's liability is capped at 12 months of fees.
-   **Missing Protections:** The contract lacks a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for support, mutual indemnification for breach, and any clauses regarding data protection or privacy.
-   **Overall Risk Level:** **High** for the MSP. The agreement is heavily weighted in favor of the Company, imposing significant liability on the MSP while strictly limiting its own.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
-   **Top Priority:** The MSP must negotiate the broad indemnification clause to be more specific and reciprocal.
-   **Should Legal Review:** **Yes.** The one-sided liability, indemnity, and termination clauses, along with the absence of data privacy terms, require professional legal negotiation.

**8. LEGAL REVIEW CITATIONS**
