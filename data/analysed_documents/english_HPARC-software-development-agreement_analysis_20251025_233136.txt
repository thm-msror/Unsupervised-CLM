### **Contract Analysis Report**

**1. BASIC INFO**
- **Contract Type:** Software Development Agreement.
- **Main Parties:** HEMISFAIR PARK AREA REDEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (HPARC) and an unnamed Software Developer.
- **Purpose:** HPARC is retaining the Software Developer to develop, maintain, and support the "Telecommunication Billing and HPARC Care System".

**2. KEY DATES**
- **Start Date:** Not specified (Date is blank, in 2021).
- **End Date:** Not specified (Term length is blank); the contract continues based on future need until terminated.
- **Important Deadlines:** Delivery Dates are mentioned in an "Implementation Plan" (not provided), with a $100/day penalty for delays.

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
- **Total Value:** Not specified (Lump sum amount is blank).
- **Payment Schedule:** Monthly invoices based on a percentage of task completion, payable by HPARC within 30 days of receipt.
- **Late Fees:** No late payment fees are mentioned for HPARC.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
- **Party 1 (Software Developer) Must:** Develop and support the specified software system and provide weekly status reports. They must also ensure all work is considered "work made for hire" owned by HPARC.
- **Party 2 (HPARC) Must:** Pay undisputed invoices within 30 days and provide the developer with necessary business designs and system access.

**5. LEGALITY**
- **Governing Law:** State of Texas.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Binding arbitration in Washington, D.C., under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- **High Risk Items:** The contract grants HPARC excessive control and one-sided termination rights. IP ownership terms are extremely broad, stripping the developer of all rights to the work product.
- **Clause References:**
    - HPARC can terminate without cause by paying just one month's billing, which is a very low exit cost: **"...payment to the Software Developer of amounts equivalent to the prior one (1) months’ billing amounts." - Section 7b**
    - All work product, including original material, becomes the sole property of HPARC, with the developer reserving no rights: **"...shall be deemed “work made for hire”... No rights are reserved by Software Developer." - Section 9f**
    - Acceptance of work is based on a subjective standard: **"All services shall be rendered to the good faith satisfaction of HPARC." - Section 6a**
- **Missing Protections:** The agreement lacks a Limitation of Liability clause for the developer and has no clear, objective acceptance criteria for deliverables.
- **Overall Risk Level:** **High for the Software Developer.** The agreement is heavily skewed in favor of HPARC, particularly regarding termination, IP ownership, and subjective acceptance standards.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Top Priority:** The Software Developer must negotiate the termination clause (Section 7b) and the "work made for hire" provision (Section 9f) to protect its business and intellectual property. All blank fields (dates, fees) must be completed before signing.
- **Should Legal Review:** **Yes.** The uncapped indemnities, broad IP clauses, and one-sided termination rights create significant legal and financial exposure that requires professional legal counsel to mitigate.

**8. LEGAL REVIEW CITATIONS**
- **Risk Clause 1:** "HPARC may terminate this Agreement at any time, without cause, upon ninety (90) days’ prior notification or payment to the Software Developer of amounts equivalent to the prior one (1) months’ billing amounts." - **Location: Section 7, Paragraph b**
- **Risk Clause 2:** "The parties acknowledge that any work performed by Software Developer for HPARC is being created at the insistence of HPARC and shall be deemed “work made for hire” under United States copyright law." - **Location: Section 9, Paragraph f**
- **Key Terms Location:**
    - Subjective Acceptance: "All services shall be rendered to the good faith satisfaction of HPARC." - **Location: Section 6, Paragraph a**
    - Staffing Control: "HPARC reserves the right to have any of Software Developer’s personnel removed from HPARC’s projects for any reason that HPARC deems necessary..." - **Location: Section 3, Paragraph a(iii)**
- **Review Priority Areas:** Section 6 (Warranty), Section 7 (Termination), Section 9 (Deliverables and IP Rights), Section 12 (Indemnity), and Section 13 (Intellectual Property Indemnification).
