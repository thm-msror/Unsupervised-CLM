### **Contract Analysis Report**

**1. BASIC INFO**
- **Contract Type:** An Amended and Restated Intercompany Services and Cost Allocation Agreement.
- **Main Parties:** AMERICAN FAMILY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, S.I. (“AFMIC”) and its various affiliates.
- **Purpose:** To establish a framework for AFMIC and its affiliates to provide goods and services to each other and allocate the associated costs.

**2. KEY DATES**
- **Start Date:** Effective for each affiliate on the date it becomes a signatory to the agreement.
- **End Date:** The initial term is five years, but it automatically extends by one year every December 31, creating a perpetual five-year term.
- **Important Deadlines:** Parties must settle all charges on a net basis "not less than quarterly."

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
- **Total Value:** Not specified; it is a cost-allocation framework based on actual costs and fair value.
- **Payment Schedule:** Settlements are due on a net basis at least quarterly.
- **Late Fees:** Not specified.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
- **Party 1 (Service Provider) Must:** Provide goods and services using its "best efforts" and maintain accurate records of all transactions.
- **Party 2 (Service Recipient) Must:** Pay its allocable share of costs for services received and indemnify the Service Provider against third-party claims.

**5. LEGALITY**
- **Governing Law:** The laws of the State of Wisconsin.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Not specified in the document.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- **High Risk Items:** AFMIC holds unilateral power to change cost allocation methods; service quality standards are vague and capped at the provider's own internal level.
- **Clause References:**
    - Unilateral Changes: "...may be amended by AFMIC in its reasonable discretion, upon notice to the Affiliates..." - Section 1.1
    - Vague Standards: "...each Service Provider hereunder shall have no obligation to provide Management Services to a Service Recipient of a quality greater than the quality of such Management Services that the Service Provider maintains for its own operations." - Section 2.2
- **Missing Protections:** The agreement lacks a formal dispute resolution clause (e.g., mediation or arbitration) and confidentiality provisions.
- **Overall Risk Level:** **Medium.** The unilateral amendment power and lack of a dispute resolution process create significant risk for affiliates, though the intercompany nature may mitigate practical conflicts.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Top Priority:** Affiliates should negotiate for mutual consent on any changes to cost allocation methods, rather than allowing AFMIC's "reasonable discretion."
- **Should Legal Review:** **Yes.** The unilateral amendment clause, vague service standards, and lack of dispute resolution procedures require legal review to protect the interests of the affiliates.

**8. LEGAL REVIEW CITATIONS**
- **Risk Clause 1:** Quote: "...The allocation and settlement methods described above shall be periodically reviewed, and may be amended by AFMIC in its reasonable discretion, upon notice to the Affiliates..." - Location: Section 1.1, Paragraph 6.
