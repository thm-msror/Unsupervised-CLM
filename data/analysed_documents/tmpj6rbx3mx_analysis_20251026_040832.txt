### **1. CONTRACT OVERVIEW**

*   **Document Type and Purpose:**
    *   **Type:** This is an "Amended and Restated Intercompany Services and Cost Allocation Agreement." It is a formal, legally binding contract that governs the provision of services and sharing of costs among related corporate entities. The "Amended and Restated" designation indicates that it replaces and supersedes any previous versions of such an agreement.
    *   **Purpose:** The primary goals of this agreement are twofold:
        1.  To create an efficient and cost-effective framework for a central company (AFMIC) and its subsidiaries to share resources, goods, and a wide range of administrative and management services.
        2.  To establish a clear and defensible methodology for allocating the costs of these services. The stated intent is to ensure that the company providing the service is reimbursed for its actual costs (or fair value) without generating a profit, and the company receiving the service does not pay more than fair market value. This is crucial for regulatory, accounting, and tax compliance (transfer pricing).

*   **Primary Business Relationship:**
    *   The relationship is between a parent or central service company (**AFMIC**) and its affiliated or subsidiary companies. It is not an arm's-length transaction between unrelated parties but an internal arrangement within a corporate group. The agreement formalizes this by defining the roles of "Service Provider" and "Service Recipient," which can be interchangeable among the parties. The relationship is explicitly defined as one of an **independent contractor** (Section 2.3), not a partnership or joint venture.

### **2. KEY PARTIES**

*   **All Contracting Parties and Their Roles:**
    *   **American Family Mutual Insurance Company, S.I. ("AFMIC"):** The central entity in the agreement. AFMIC can act as both a **Service Provider** (offering goods and services to its subsidiaries) and a **Service Recipient** (receiving services from its subsidiaries). It also holds the authority to amend the cost allocation methods (Section 1.1).
    *   **The Subsidiaries ("الشركات التابعة"):** These are the other signatories to the agreement. Like AFMIC, each subsidiary can function as both a **Service Provider** and a **Service Recipient**. They become party to the agreement either by signing the main document or by executing a "Joinder Agreement" (Exhibit A).
    *   **Joining Party ("الطرف المنضم"):** This refers to any subsidiary that becomes a party to the agreement after its initial execution by using the "Form of Joinder" provided in Exhibit A.

*   **Legal Entities Involved:**
    *   The contract explicitly names **American Family Mutual Insurance Company, S.I. (AFMIC)**.
    *   The signature pages also list:
        *   **American Family Insurance Holding Company**
        *   **AMFAM Holding Company**
    *   Any other subsidiary that signs the agreement or a Joinder Agreement becomes a legal party.

### **3. IMPORTANT DATES**

*   **Effective Dates:**
    *   The agreement has a **rolling effective date**. For each individual subsidiary, the agreement becomes effective on the date that subsidiary first signs it or a Joinder Agreement ("Initial Effective Date").

*   **Expiration Dates:**
    *   **Initial Term:** The agreement has an initial term of **five years** from the Initial Effective Date for each respective subsidiary.
    *   **Automatic Renewal ("Evergreen Clause"):** The contract includes an automatic renewal provision. On December 31st of each year, the term is extended by one additional year. This ensures that the agreement always maintains a rolling five-year term, providing long-term stability unless actively terminated.

*   **Key Deadlines and Milestones:**
    *   **Settlement of Charges:** All fees and charges incurred under the agreement must be settled by the parties on a net basis **at least quarterly** (Section 1.1).
    *   **Termination Notice:** AFMIC can terminate the agreement with a subsidiary in the event of insolvency by providing **30 days' prior written notice** (Section 5).

### **4. FINANCIAL TERMS**

*   **Payment Amounts and Schedules:**
    *   Payments are based on cost allocation, not profit. The goal is to reimburse the Service Provider for its costs.
    *   All payments are settled on a net basis among the parties at least quarterly.

*   **Pricing Structures (Cost Allocation Methods - Section 1.1):**
    The agreement outlines specific methods for calculating charges:
    *   **Goods:** Billed at **pass-through cost** based on actual usage.
    *   **Third-Party Services:** Billed at **pass-through cost** based on actual usage.
    *   **Office Space:** A monthly rent is charged based on the actual square footage used, billed at least quarterly.
    *   **Management Services:** Billed using one of the following methods, as appropriate:
        1.  **FTE Percentage:** A percentage of a Full-Time Equivalent employee's salary and benefits, proportional to the time spent on services for the recipient.
        2.  **Actual Hours:** The actual hours worked by the provider's staff multiplied by an internally determined billing rate.
        3.  **Fair Market Value:** The price the Service Recipient would have paid an unaffiliated third party for the same services in an arm's-length transaction.

*   **Penalties and Fees:**
    *   The contract does not specify any penalties for late payments or fees for non-performance. Remedies for breaches would fall under general legal and equitable principles as governed by Wisconsin law.

### **5. LEGAL FRAMEWORK**

*   **Governing Law:**
    *   The agreement is explicitly to be interpreted and enforced according to the laws of the **State of Wisconsin** (Section 6.10).

*   **Jurisdiction:**
    *   While not explicitly stated, the governing law and the significant role given to the **Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance** strongly imply that legal jurisdiction would reside with the courts in Wisconsin.

*   **Dispute Resolution:**
    *   The contract **does not contain a specific dispute resolution clause** (e.g., mandatory arbitration or mediation). Therefore, any disputes that cannot be resolved amicably would likely be settled through litigation in the appropriate courts under Wisconsin law.

### **6. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**

*   **Each Party's Responsibilities:**
    *   **Service Provider's Obligations:**
        *   Provide goods, third-party services, and management services as needed.
        *   Perform services according to a defined standard of care: complying with applicable law, matching the quality of its own internal operations, and meeting the standards of the insurance industry (Section 2.2).
        *   Maintain accurate and detailed books and records of all services provided and costs incurred, which must be open to inspection by the Service Recipient and regulators (Section 3).
    *   **Service Recipient's Obligations:**
        *   Pay for all services received in accordance with the cost allocation methodologies.
        *   Settle all payments on a net basis at least quarterly.
        *   Indemnify the Service Provider against third-party claims arising from the services provided (unless caused by the provider's negligence, misconduct, or fraud) (Section 4).

*   **Deliverables and Requirements:**
    *   The primary deliverables are the "Goods," "Third-Party Services," and a comprehensive list of "Management Services," including executive, legal, IT, HR, marketing, finance, underwriting, claims, and more.
    *   A key requirement is the maintenance of transparent and auditable records to justify all cost allocations. For insurance company recipients, these records are considered the property of the recipient.

### **7. RISK ANALYSIS**

*   **High-Risk Clauses:**
    *   **Indemnification (Section 4):** This clause presents a significant risk. The Service Recipient provides a broad indemnity to the Service Provider for all third-party claims, except those arising from the provider's gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud. This could expose a subsidiary to liability for issues not directly under its control. The provider's reciprocal indemnity is much narrower.
    *   **AFMIC's Discretion to Amend (Section 1.1):** AFMIC retains "reasonable discretion" to modify the cost allocation methods. While this power must be applied uniformly, it gives the central entity significant control over the financial terms affecting all subsidiaries.
    *   **Termination Rights (Section 5 & 6.2):** The termination rights are asymmetrical. AFMIC has clear rights to terminate for a subsidiary's insolvency (unless it's an insurer). However, subsidiaries have no automatic right to terminate if AFMIC enters receivership; they are obligated to continue providing services as long as they are paid.

*   **Potential Liability Issues:**
    *   **Standard of Care (Section 2.2):** The defined standard of care is subjective and could become a point of contention. A dispute could arise if a Service Recipient believes the quality of service led to a business loss.
    *   **Independent Contractor Status (Section 2.3):** If the parties' conduct blurs the line between an independent contractor and a partnership/agency relationship, they could face unintended joint liability for each other's actions.
    *   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As this is an agreement between insurance entities, it is subject to intense regulatory oversight. Any perceived unfairness in cost allocation or failure to maintain proper records could lead to regulatory intervention, fines, or other sanctions from insurance commissioners.

*   **Compliance Requirements:**
    *   **Insurance Regulations:** The agreement is drafted to comply with insurance holding company laws. It explicitly references the **Wisconsin Commissioner of Insurance** and the procedures to be followed in case of insolvency or receivership (Section 6.2). Any assignment of rights requires regulatory approval (Section 6.4).
    *   **Record-Keeping and Auditing (Section 3):** The obligation to maintain detailed, accurate, and accessible records is a critical compliance requirement, both for internal governance and to satisfy regulators.
    *   **Tax and Accounting Principles:** The entire cost allocation framework is designed to adhere to the "arm's-length principle" for transfer pricing between related entities. Failure to do so could result in significant tax liabilities and penalties.
