    - **Corelight, Inc.**:
        - Grant a non-exclusive license to the MSP for product distribution.
        - Provide standard support services to the MSP.

        - Indemnify Corelight against claims arising from the MSP's breach of the agreement or its business activities.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK & COMPLIANCE ALERTS
- **High-Risk Clauses**:
    - The MSP's obligation to indemnify Corelight should be reviewed to ensure its scope is reasonable and insurable.
- **Missing Standard Clauses**:
    - **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**: **CRITICAL OMISSION.** The absence of this clause creates significant legal uncertainty regarding how disputes would be resolved and which laws apply.
    - **Confidentiality & Data Protection**: Not mentioned in the analysis, their absence would be a major risk.
    - **Force Majeure**: Not mentioned; its absence leaves ambiguity in handling unforeseen events.
- **Compliance Issues**:
    - **Unnamed Counterparty**: The agreement is fundamentally incomplete without the legal name and details of the "Managed Service Provider."
- **Consistency Warnings**:
    - The term "MSP" is used, but the party is not formally defined with its legal name, which could lead to enforcement issues.

### üí° AI-GENERATED INSIGHTS
- **Contract Purpose**: This agreement creates a scalable sales and service channel for Corelight, leveraging the MSP's infrastructure and customer relationships to grow its market presence.
- **Strategic Importance**: This is a key document for indirect sales strategy. It allows Corelight to enter new markets or serve specific customer segments efficiently without the overhead of direct sales and support teams.
- **Legal Advice**:
    - **The immediate priority is to define the Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** This should be rectified via an addendum.
    - The identity of the MSP must be formally documented in the agreement.
    - A full review is needed to check for other missing standard clauses like Confidentiality, Limitation of Liability, and Data Protection.
- **Regulatory Comparisons**: It is impossible to compare this agreement to applicable laws or standards without a defined jurisdiction. For example, data privacy obligations (like GDPR or CCPA) cannot be assessed.

### üìà EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Immediate Actions Required**:
    1.  **Identify the MSP**: Confirm the full legal name and details of the counterparty and amend the contract.
    2.  **Define Legal Framework**: **Immediately negotiate and add a Governing Law and Jurisdiction clause** via a formal addendum. This is the highest priority.
- **Legal Review Priority**: **High**
    - The absence of a governing law clause and the unidentified counterparty represent fundamental contract risks that must be addressed before proceeding.
- **Business Impact Assessment**:
    - **Financial**: The revenue model is variable and depends on the MSP's performance. The financial risk to Corelight is low, but the potential for disputes is high without a legal framework.
    - **Operational**: The partnership's success depends on the MSP's capabilities. A dispute could disrupt service for multiple end customers and damage Corelight's reputation.
- **Next Steps**:
    1.  **Contact the business team** to get the legal details of the MSP.
    2.  **Instruct the legal team** to draft an addendum specifying the governing law and jurisdiction, acceptable to both parties.
    3.  **Initiate a full contract review** to identify and add other missing standard clauses (Confidentiality, Force Majeure, etc.) to mitigate future risks.
