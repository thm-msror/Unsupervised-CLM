    - Corelight, Inc. (‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)
    - **Managed Service Provider (‚ÄúMSP‚Äù) - Critical Gap: The specific legal entity for the MSP is not identified in the analysis.**
- **Critical Dates**:
    - **Effective Date**: The last date the agreement is signed by both parties.
    - **Expiration Date**: 12 months from the Effective Date (initial term).
    - **Renewal Date**: **Automatically renews for successive 12-month periods** unless terminated.
    - **Key Deadlines**: Invoices are due within 30 days. Termination without cause requires 90 days' advance notice.
- **Financial Terms**:
    - **Payment Amounts**: Variable, based on purchase orders placed against a price list. No fixed total value is specified.
    - **Payment Schedule**: Subscriptions are billed in advance (monthly, quarterly, or annually). All invoices are due net 30 days.
    - **Penalties**: Late payments may incur interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law.
- **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**:
    - **Not specified in the provided analysis.** This is a critical missing element.
- **Key Obligations & Deliverables**:
    - **Corelight, Inc. Must**:
        - Grant a non-exclusive license to the MSP.
        - Provide standard support services for its products.
    - **MSP Must**:
        - Pay all fees according to the payment schedule.
        - Ensure its own customer agreements offer protection to Corelight that is equivalent to or greater than Corelight's standard Master Customer Agreement.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK & COMPLIANCE ALERTS
- **High-Risk Clauses**:
    - **Automatic Renewal**: The contract automatically renews for 12-month terms. This could lock the Company into an undesirable relationship if performance is not monitored before the 90-day cancellation window.
- **Missing Standard Clauses**:
    - **Major Gaps Identified**: The analysis lacks sections on **Governing Law, Jurisdiction, Confidentiality, Data Protection, Liability Limitations, and Force Majeure.** The absence of these clauses in the final contract would represent a significant legal risk.
- **Compliance Issues**:
    - The obligation for the MSP to flow down protective terms to its customers is critical but can be difficult to audit and enforce. A compliance check mechanism is recommended.
- **Consistency Warnings**:
    - **Unnamed Party**: The agreement refers to an "MSP" without specifying the legal name. **This makes the contract legally unenforceable until the party is clearly identified.**

### üí° AI-GENERATED INSIGHTS
- **Contract Purpose**: This agreement creates a scalable sales channel for Corelight, leveraging the MSP's existing customer base to resell its technology and services without the direct cost of sales.
- **Strategic Importance**: This is a standard channel partnership agreement. Its success is vital for indirect revenue growth and market penetration. The performance of the MSP directly impacts the Company's revenue and brand reputation.
- **Legal Advice**: It is crucial to conduct a full legal review to draft and include the missing standard clauses (Governing Law, Confidentiality, etc.). The identity of the MSP must be confirmed and explicitly stated in the agreement.
- **Regulatory Comparisons**: The structure is typical for B2B reseller agreements. However, without a Data Protection clause, it may not be compliant with regulations like GDPR or CCPA if personal data is processed.

### üìà EXECUTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
- **Immediate Actions Required**:
    1.  **Identify the MSP**: Confirm the full legal name and details of the Managed Service Provider and insert them into the agreement.
    2.  **Draft Addendum**: Immediately engage the legal team to draft the missing critical clauses (Governing Law, Confidentiality, Liability, etc.). **Do not sign the agreement until these are included.**
- **Legal Review Priority**: **High**
    - The absence of an identified counterparty and fundamental legal clauses makes this document incomplete and high-risk.
- **Business Impact Assessment**:
    - **Financial**: The agreement presents a revenue opportunity but lacks predictability as it's based on MSP performance. The lack of liability clauses exposes the Company to potentially unlimited financial risk.
    - **Operational**: The business team must establish a process to monitor MSP sales and ensure compliance with the "protective terms" requirement.
- **Next Steps**:
    1.  **Halt Execution**: Pause the signing process until the identified gaps are filled.
    2.  **Legal Redline**: Submit the agreement for a full legal redline and negotiation.
    3.  **Define Performance Metrics**: Consider adding specific performance metrics (e.g., minimum sales targets) for the MSP to ensure the partnership is productive.
