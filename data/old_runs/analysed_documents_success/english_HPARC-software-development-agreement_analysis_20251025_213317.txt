**2. KEY DATES**

- End Date: "continue for __________." (Not specified, then "until terminated as provided herein").
- Important Deadlines: Weekly reports (Section 3b), 30-day payment term (Section 4d), 1-year warranty (Section 6d), 90-day termination notice by HPARC without cause (Section 7b).

**5. LEGALITY**
- Governing Law: Laws of the State of Texas.
- Dispute Resolution: Arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in Washington, D.C.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- High Risk Items: The contract has an unspecified term, grants HPARC unilateral control over staffing decisions and removal, imposes an exclusivity clause on Software Developer's resources, and includes a broad non-compete clause. There's also a potential conflict between "work made for hire" and Software Developer's proprietary software, and a low fixed penalty for delays.
- Clause References:
    - "Subject to Section 7, the term of this Agreement shall commence on the date set forth above, and continue for __________." - Section 2.
    - "HPARC reserves the right to approve all staffing decisions." and "HPARC reserves the right to have any of Software Developer’s personnel removed from HPARC’s projects for any reason that HPARC deems necessary for quality and performance." - Section 3c.
    - "Resources shall be applied exclusively to HPARC projects, and will not be shared with other projects that Software Developer may support." - Section 3c.
    - "the Software Developer agrees not to develop, design, code, test or document a competing product." and "without the prior written consent of the HPARC, it will not enter into any discussions with any party with respect to the foregoing applications and deliverables for a period commencing on the date of this Agreement and terminating on that day which is the third anniversary of the acceptance by the HPARC of the last deliverable provided under this Agreement." - Section 8a.
    - "The parties acknowledge that any work performed by Software Developer for HPARC is being created at the insistence of HPARC and shall be deemed “work made for hire” under United States copyright law." - Section 11e.
    - "Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections 9a) and 9b) above, it is understood and agreed that Software Developer may, in its sole discretion, use its proprietary software programs in providing Services. If Software Developer uses any such proprietary software programs and so notifies HPARC, HPARC shall not market or in any way use such software programs as independent “stand-alone” programs without the express written consent of Software Developer, and HPARC shall not acquire any proprietary rights to such programs." - Section 9d.
    - "HPARC shall be entitled to a credit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per calendar day that the delivery of the System is delayed past the applicable Delivery Date." - Section 14.
    - "HPARC may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief to restrain such breach or threat of breach, without disentitling HPARC from any other relief in either law or equity." - Section 24.
- Missing Protections: A general limitation of liability clause, detailed acceptance criteria, and comprehensive data privacy/security provisions are notably absent.
- Overall Risk Level: High. The contract contains significant ambiguities, one-sided clauses, and critical missing protections, particularly for the Software Developer.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Top Priority: Clarify the contract term and total fees, negotiate the scope of the non-compete and exclusivity clauses, and add a comprehensive limitation of liability.
- Should Legal Review: Yes, immediately. The document has several high-risk clauses and omissions that require expert legal review and negotiation.
