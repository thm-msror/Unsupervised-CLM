**6. RISKS FOUND**

    - **Limited Company Warranty & Extensive Disclaimers:** Company provides a very short 90-day limited warranty and disclaims all other warranties, including merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
    - **Severe Limitation of Company's Liability:** Company excludes all indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages and caps direct damages to amounts received in the preceding twelve (12) months.
    - **Non-refundable Fees:** All fees paid by MSP are explicitly non-refundable, even upon termination.
    - **Broad Audit Rights:** Company has extensive audit rights, and MSP bears audit costs if underpayment exceeds 5% or license restrictions are violated.
- Clause References:
    - "MSP further represents, warrants, and agrees not to copy, modify, rent, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise reverse engineer the any Company product or software, or otherwise attempt to learn the source code, structure, algorithms, or ideas underlying any Company products or software, except to the extent, and only the extent, this clause is expressly prohibited by applicable law, or allow any others to do the same." - Section 10, Page 3.
    - "TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE WARRANTIES STATED ABOVE ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR QUALITY OF SERVICE." - Section 9.3, Page 3.

IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY COMPANY PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT FROM MSP IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION." - Section 14, Page 4.

- Missing Protections: No specific data privacy/security clause beyond general confidentiality; no limitation on Company's audit frequency if "reasonably assert" over-usage; no clear termination for convenience for MSP without financial penalty.
- Overall Risk Level: High. The agreement heavily favors the Company, placing significant liability, compliance, and financial burdens on the MSP with limited recourse.
