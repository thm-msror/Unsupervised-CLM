Here's an analysis of the provided contract:

**1. BASIC INFO**
- Contract Type: Web Site Development Agreement.
- Main Parties: Software Distribution Company ("The Company") and Off-Site Web Site Development Company ("The Developer").
- Purpose: To develop, create, test, and deliver a website named "Whizzer's Web" and provide hosting services.

**2. KEY DATES**
- Start Date: [ﺍﻟﺘﺎﺭﻳﺦ] ("Effective Date").
- End Date: 99 years from the Effective Date, unless terminated earlier.
- Important Deadlines: Trade show demonstration in New York by [ﺍﻟﺘﺎﺭﻳﺦ]; project planning meeting within one week of signing.

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
- Total Value: $7,500.00 for development, plus $1,000.00 monthly for hosting.
- Payment Schedule: $7,500.00 upon signing, an additional $2,500.00 when the website is reasonably acceptable. Hosting fees start on the final website go-live date and are due monthly thereafter.
- Late Fees: Not specified.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
- Party 1 Must: Provide materials, pay development and hosting fees, provide space for the trade show demo, and approve the final website.
- Party 2 Must: Design, develop, host, test, and deliver the "Whizzer's Web" website, display it at a trade show, register the domain, provide backups, and provide monthly traffic analysis.

**5. LEGALITY**
- Governing Law: Laws of New York.
- Dispute Resolution: State or Federal courts in New York, with parties agreeing to jurisdiction and waiving jurisdictional defenses.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- High Risk Items:
    - **IP Ownership of Future Materials:** Ambiguity regarding ownership of future additions to the website by the Developer.
    - **Limitation of Liability:** Developer's total liability is capped at twice the revenue generated, which may be insufficient for significant damages, especially for IP infringement.
    - **Developer's Confidentiality Waiver:** The Company explicitly states it does not wish to receive confidential information from the Developer, and any information provided by the Developer will not be considered confidential or proprietary.
    - **Trade Show Deadline:** A specific, time-sensitive obligation with a placeholder date creates a hard deadline and potential for breach if missed.
- Missing Protections: No clear Service Level Agreement (SLA) for hosting uptime, no specific penalties for delays, no detailed exit strategy for hosting, and no specific data security/privacy compliance provisions.
- Overall Risk Level: High, due to significant ambiguities in IP ownership, a low liability cap for the Developer, and a broad waiver of confidentiality for the Developer's information.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Top Priority: Clarify IP ownership for all current and future website components and re-evaluate the Developer's liability cap.
- Should Legal Review: Yes, due to significant IP, liability, and confidentiality risks, as well as missing standard protections.
