- Main Parties: SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION COMPANY ("COMPANY") and OUT-OF-SITE WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY ("DEVELOPER").
- Purpose: DEVELOPER to design, develop, test, deliver, and host a Web Site ("Whizzer’s Web") for COMPANY.

- End Date: "99 years, unless otherwise terminated as provided herein" (Section 9.A).
- Important Deadlines: Trade Show demonstration on "[date]", project planning meeting within one week of signing, and modifications within 5 or 10 business days (Section 3.A).

- Total Value: Development Fee of $7,500.00 plus a Hosting Fee of $1,000.00 per month.
- Payment Schedule: Development Fee paid in two installments ($7,500 upon signing, $2,500 when operational); Hosting Fee monthly on anniversary of operational date; other work invoiced bi-weekly, due 15 days after receipt.

- Party 2 Must: Design, develop, test, deliver, and host the Web Site, adhere to the schedule, ensure a professional image, and indemnify COMPANY against intellectual property infringement.

**5. LEGALITY**
- Governing Law: Laws of New York (Section 15).
- Dispute Resolution: Resolved in the applicable state or federal courts of New York (Section 15).

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- High Risk Items: The DEVELOPER's total liability is capped at "twice the amount of revenue derived by DEVELOPER under this Agreement" (Section 6.D), which is a low cap for potential IP infringement. The 99-year term is unusually long and inflexible (Section 9.A). Compensation for advertising assistance is an "agreement to agree" (Section 2.H).
- Clause References: "DEVELOPER’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed twice the amount of revenue derived by DEVELOPER under this Agreement." - Section 6.D. "This Agreement shall be effective as of the Effective Date and shall remain in force for a period of 99 years" - Section 9.A. "the parties agree to enter into good faith negotiations to reasonably compensate DEVELOPER for such services." - Section 2.H.
- Missing Protections: No explicit Service Level Agreement (SLA) for hosting uptime or detailed performance metrics. No specific data privacy or security clauses beyond general confidentiality. No source code escrow provision.
- Overall Risk Level: High. Significant liability limitations for DEVELOPER, vague compensation terms, an extremely long contract term, and missing standard protections create substantial risk for COMPANY.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Top Priority: Re-negotiate the liability cap, clarify compensation for advertising, and revise the 99-year term and DEVELOPER's termination rights.
- Should Legal Review: Yes, immediately and thoroughly, due to several high-risk clauses and missing protections.
