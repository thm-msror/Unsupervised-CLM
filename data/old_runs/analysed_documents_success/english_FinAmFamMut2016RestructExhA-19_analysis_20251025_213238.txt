==================================================

**1. BASIC INFO**
- Contract Type: Amended and Restated Intercompany Services and Cost Allocation Agreement.
- Main Parties: AMERICAN FAMILY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, S.I. ("AFMIC") and its Affiliates.
- Purpose: To govern the provision of goods, third-party services, and management services between AFMIC and its affiliates, and to allocate associated costs.

**2. KEY DATES**
- Start Date: Effective as to each Affiliate on the date such Affiliate first becomes a signatory (Initial Effective Date).
- End Date: Initially five years from the Initial Effective Date, automatically extended by one year each December 31st to maintain a five-year term.
- Important Deadlines: Parties shall settle all charges incurred under this Agreement on a net basis not less than quarterly (Section 1.1).

**3. MONEY MATTERS**
- Total Value: Not specified; charges are based on allocable share of actual costs or fair value.
- Payment Schedule: Charges are settled on a net basis not less than quarterly (Section 1.1).
- Late Fees: Not specified.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**
- Party 1 (Service Provider) Must: Provide Goods, Third Party Services, and Management Services using best efforts and charge Service Recipients based on actual costs or fair value.
- Party 2 (Service Recipient) Must: Pay its allocable share of costs/fair value for received services and indemnify the Service Provider for third-party claims unless due to the Service Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.

**5. LEGALITY**
- Governing Law: Laws of the State of Wisconsin (Section 6.9).
- Dispute Resolution: Not explicitly detailed beyond general legal or equity remedies for termination (Section 5.3).

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- High Risk Items:
    - **Unilateral Amendment of Allocation Methods**: AFMIC can unilaterally amend cost allocation and settlement methods in its "reasonable discretion" (Section 1.1). This grants AFMIC significant control over financial terms without explicit affiliate consent.
    - **Service Quality Limitation**: Service Provider has "no obligation to provide Management Services to a Service Recipient of a quality greater than the quality of such Management Services that the Service Provider maintains for its own operations" (Section 2.2). This could lead to disputes if a Service Recipient expects higher standards.
    - **AFMIC's Control in Delinquency**: If AFMIC is in delinquency proceedings, Affiliates have "no automatic right to terminate this Agreement" and must continue services if paid (Section 6.2). This could force Affiliates to support a financially distressed entity.
- Missing Protections:
    - Specific dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., mediation, arbitration) are not detailed.
    - Clear limitations on liability for Service Providers, especially for indirect or consequential damages, are not explicitly stated beyond the indemnification clause.
    - Performance metrics or Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for Management Services are absent, relying on "best efforts" and internal standards.
- Overall Risk Level: Medium-High. The unilateral amendment power, limited service quality commitment, and lack of automatic termination rights for affiliates during AFMIC's delinquency pose significant financial and operational risks, particularly for the Affiliates.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Top Priority: Review the clause allowing AFMIC to unilaterally amend cost allocation methods and the indemnification provisions to ensure equitable terms and mitigate financial exposure for Affiliates.
- Should Legal Review: Yes. A legal review is crucial to assess the financial and operational implications of the cost allocation, indemnification, service quality standards, and termination clauses, especially from the perspective of the Affiliates.

**8. LEGAL REVIEW CITATIONS**
- Risk Clause 1: "The allocation and settlement methods described above shall be periodically reviewed, and may be amended by AFMIC in its reasonable discretion, upon notice to the Affiliates..." - Section 1.1, last paragraph.
- Risk Clause 2: "Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Service Recipient hereunder agrees that each Service Provider hereunder shall have no obligation to provide Management Services to a Service Recipient of a quality greater than the quality of such Management Services that the Service Provider maintains for its own operations." - Section 2.2.
