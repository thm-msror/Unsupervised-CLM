- **Important Deadlines:** Software Developer must deliver weekly reports, meet monthly, and provide a one-year warranty on the System.

**3. MONEY MATTERS**

- **Payment Schedule:** Software Developer provides monthly invoices based on percent complete, which HPARC must pay within thirty (30) days.

**5. LEGAL STUFF**
- **Governing Law:** State of Texas.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Arbitration in Washington, D.C., under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- **High Risk Items:** Key financial terms (total fee, initial term) are left blank, creating commercial uncertainty. The "work made for hire" and non-competition clauses are very broad and heavily favor HPARC, limiting the Software Developer's future business. HPARC has extensive control over Software Developer's staffing and resource allocation.
- **Missing Protections:** A general limitation of liability for the Software Developer is not explicitly detailed. A force majeure clause is not present in the provided sections.
- **Overall Risk Level:** High

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **Top Priority:** Immediately fill in all blank commercial terms, especially the total lump sum fee and the initial term of the agreement.
- **Should Legal Review:** Yes, absolutely. The contract contains significant intellectual property, non-competition, and liability clauses that could pose substantial risks to the Software Developer.
