**3. MONEY MATTERS**

- Late Fees: Not specified.

**4. MAIN OBLIGATIONS**

- Party 2 (Subsidiaries/Service Recipient) Must: Pay its allocable share of actual costs or fair value for received goods and services. Indemnify the Service Provider for third-party claims unless due to the Service Provider's negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.
