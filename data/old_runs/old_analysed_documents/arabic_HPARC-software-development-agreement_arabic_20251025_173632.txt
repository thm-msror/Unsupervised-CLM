**5. LEGAL STUFF**
- Governing Law: Laws of the State of Texas, excluding conflict of laws principles.
- Dispute Resolution: Arbitration according to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in Washington D.C.

**6. RISKS FOUND**
- High Risk Items: Critical blank fields (start date, term, total value, developer name), potentially conflicting IP ownership clauses ("work for hire" vs. developer's proprietary programs), broad non-compete clause, and lack of explicit limitation of liability.
- Missing Protections: No clear definition of "confidential information" (though it refers to a separate agreement), no explicit limitation of liability for either party, and no mention of source code escrow.
- Overall Risk Level: High.

**7. RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Top Priority: Fill in all blank fields, especially the Software Developer's name, start date, term, and total contract value. Reconcile the conflicting IP ownership clauses regarding "work for hire" and the developer's proprietary software.
- Should Legal Review: Yes, due to the numerous blank fields, potential IP conflicts, broad non-compete clause, and absence of standard liability limitations.
